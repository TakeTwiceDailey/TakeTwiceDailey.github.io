`$\def\hbar{\mathit{\rlap{\unicode{xAF}}h}}$`

## About

Here you will find an archive of my personal interests and history. You can take a look at my curriculum vitae, a synopsis of my research, some of my photography, or check out some of my blog posts.

I am a graduate student researching physics. Some of my interests are

* strong gravity
  * special and general relativity
  * black hole and neutron star mergers
  * quantum gravity
* Bayesian statistics
  * statistical modeling
  * Monte-Carlo simulations
* machine learning


testing inline math `$\hbar^2+b^2=c^2$`, but what about centered math?

`$$\large \left(\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^{\,2}}{ \partial\, t^2}  - \frac{\partial^{\,2}}{ \partial\, r^2} + \frac{m^2c^2}{\hbar^2} \right) u(r,t) = 0 $$`

and special characters? What about `$\alpha$` and `$\beta$`?
