<p>Have you ever wondered why you canâ€™t seem to rotate a tennis racket head-over-handle? If you do, it wonâ€™t do it in a stable manner, it will flip along other directions too. This is a demonstration of the
intermediate axis theorem (also referred to as the tennis racket theorem or the Dzhanibekov effect). It is a feature of Eulerâ€™s equations which govern rigid body rotation. His equations are first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), but they are by no means trivial to solve since they are coupled and non-linear. Rigid bodies and Eulerâ€™s equations have been studied in detail for at least the last 200 years and exact solutions are known, although they involve elliptic functions. An easier way to visualize the problem was coined by Poinsot, known as Poinsotâ€™s construction. Instead of solving Eulerâ€™s equations, Poinsot enforced conservation of energy and angular momentum as constraints on the solutions, and visualized the solution paths as the intersection between surfaces. I claim however that to understand the intermediate axis theorem, one does not need to directly solve Eulerâ€™s equations, or even enforce conservation constraints. With some manipulation, all of the dynamical features of rigid body rotation can be visualized graphically.</p>

<hr />

<p>To analyze the rotational dynamics of rigid bodies, I start with Eulerâ€™s equations in three dimensions (in the absence of applied torque),</p>

\[I\frac{d \vec \omega}{dt} +\vec\omega\times(I\vec\omega)= 0\,,\tag{1}\]

<p>where $I$ is the $3\times3$ inertia tensor and $\vec\omega$ is the angular velocity vector of the rigid body. Equation (1) is derived from Newtonâ€™s second law, but adapted into the body-fixed reference frame. The reason for this is that it ensures that the inertia tensor of the body is not changing with time. First I will substitute the body-fixed angular momentum $\vec L=I\vec\omega$ to obtain</p>

\[\frac{d \vec L}{dt} =\vec L\times(I^{-1}\vec L)\,.\tag{2}\]

<p>I will then choose a Cartesian basis $(x,y,z)$ that is aligned with the angular momentum components such that the inertia tensor can be diagonalized as</p>

\[I =\left(\def\arraystretch{1.1}{\begin{array}{ccc} I_x &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; I_y &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; I_z\end{array} }\right)\,.\tag{3}\]

<p>At this point, I am motivated to try to reduce this system to a two dimensional one, because three dimensions is just too many. To do this, I will represent this system of equations in terms of spherical coordinate variables $(r,\phi,\theta)$. In terms of these variables, the angular momentum vector can be expressed as</p>

\[\vec L =L\left[\cos(\phi)\sin(\theta)\hat x + \sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)\hat y + \cos(\theta)\hat z\right]\,.\]

<p>I can then substitute this into Equation (2) along with Equation (3) to obtain</p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{1}{L^2}\frac{d \vec L}{dt}&amp; =\;\frac{(I_y-I_z)}{I_y I_z}\sin (\theta ) \cos (\theta ) \sin (\phi )\hat x\nonumber\\&amp;
+\frac{(I_z-I_x)}{I_x I_z}\sin (\theta ) \cos (\theta ) \cos (\phi )\hat y\\&amp;
+\frac{(I_x-I_y)}{I_x I_y}\sin ^2(\theta ) \sin(\phi ) \cos (\phi )\hat z\,.
\end{align}\]

<p>This Cartesian vector can then be expressed in terms of the spherical coordinate unit vectors $(\hat r,\hat\phi,\hat\theta)$ by transforming it with the Cartesian-to-spherical transformation matrix,</p>

\[T_{x\rightarrow r}=\left(\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{array}{ccc}
 \sin (\theta ) \cos (\phi ) &amp; \sin (\theta ) \sin (\phi ) &amp; \cos (\theta ) \\
 -\sin (\phi ) &amp; \cos (\phi ) &amp; 0 \\
 \cos (\theta ) \cos (\phi ) &amp; \cos (\theta ) \sin (\phi ) &amp; -\sin (\theta ) \\
\end{array}\right)\,,\]

<p>which results in</p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{1}{L^2}\frac{d \vec L}{dt} =&amp;\frac{\left[I_x I_z+I_y I_z-2 I_x I_y+I_z (I_y-I_x) \cos (2 \phi )\right]\sin (2\theta )}{4I_x I_y I_z }\hat\phi+\frac{(I_y-I_x) \sin (\phi) \cos (\phi )\sin (\theta ) }{I_x I_y}\hat\theta\,.\tag{4}
\end{align}\]

<p>Notice that the $d \vec L/dt$ vector has no component along the $r$-direction, as should be expected given that the magnitude of $\vec L$ should not change due to the conservation of angular momentum. Just by converting Eulerâ€™s equations to spherical coordinates, we have just proven that his equations obey this crucial conservation law. The system has thus been successfully reduced to a two dimensional problem.</p>

<p>The result obtained in Equation (4) can now be plotted in a phase diagram, a plot that shows the direction of the vector field $d\vec L/dt$ as a function of $(\phi,\theta)$. Keeping in mind that vector derivatives are scaled differently in spherical coordinates compared to Cartesian ones,</p>

\[\frac{d\vec L}{dt}=\left(\frac{dL}{dt}\right)\hat r + \left(\frac{d\phi}{dt}\right)L\sin(\theta)\hat\phi + \left(\frac{d\theta}{dt}\right)L\hat\theta \,,\]

<p>I will pick out just $d\phi/dt$ and $d\theta/dt$ for the plot. To ensure there is an intermediate axis, it is assumed that $I_x&lt;I_y&lt;I_z$. This defines the $y$-axis as the intermediate axis.</p>
