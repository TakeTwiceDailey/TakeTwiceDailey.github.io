<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Most of our daily lives are lived in a physical realm well described by early physicists like Galileo. When Einstein first introduced the theory of special relativity, he effectively set a speed limit on every massive object in the universe, the speed of light <code class="highlighter-rouge">$c$</code>. This may not seem like much of a change on the surface, but this opened a whole new branch of physics that has many differences to the Galilean framework. As Galileo first described terrestrial motion, velocity addition worked in the same manner as any other vector addition. Simply add together each component of each of the velocity vectors <code class="highlighter-rouge">$\vec\beta=\vec v/c$</code> to be added:</p>

<center><code>
$\large \vec\beta_{12}=\vec\beta_1+\vec\beta_2\,.$
</code></center>
<p><br /></p>

<p class="example"><b>Example:</b> Suppose you are on a train traveling at speed <code>$\beta_1$</code> (relative to the ground) and there is a different train traveling at speed <code>$\beta_2$</code> relative to you. If you hop on this different train (according to Galileo) you will now be traveling at speed <code>$\beta_{12}$</code>.</p>
