<h2 id="short-history">Short History</h2>

<p>I studied at the University of Nevada, Reno under Dr. Andrei Derevianko and with the GPS.DM Collaboration. As an undergraduate I contributed to a search for dark matter using GPS. I completed my Masterâ€™s degree with the same group, where I researched new ways to use GPS for astrophysics applications. Our novel concept involves correlating bursts of exotic fields sourced from high-energy astrophysical events such as the LIGO gravitational wave events.</p>
