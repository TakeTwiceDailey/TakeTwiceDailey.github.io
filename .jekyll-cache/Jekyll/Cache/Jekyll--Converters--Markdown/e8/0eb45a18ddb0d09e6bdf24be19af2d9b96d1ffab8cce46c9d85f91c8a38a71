<p>At the beginning of the 1900’s, many important aspects of physics had been well developed. The best theories up to and around that date are referred to today as classical mechanics. Many scientists in this era erroneously considered physics to be relatively complete, and part of the reason for this was the lack of proper tools to investigate physics at the scales needed to see effects from the theories in modern physics <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Once technology progressed enough to give physicists the tools to investigate individual particles, they discovered mind-bending properties. It is recognized as a huge paradigm shift in science, and I will try to explain just what confused the scientists of that day.</p>

<p>I like to think that physicists are just kids on a playground, experimenting with toys. Before the 1900’s, one of their favorite games was <q>Wall-Ball</q>, a simple game that involves throwing a rubber ball repeatedly at a wall. As the good scientists they are, they recorded the <q>rules</q> that seem to govern the game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If one throws the ball at the wall, it bounces back always</li>
  <li>If one throws the ball over the wall, it continues over the wall always</li>
</ul>
