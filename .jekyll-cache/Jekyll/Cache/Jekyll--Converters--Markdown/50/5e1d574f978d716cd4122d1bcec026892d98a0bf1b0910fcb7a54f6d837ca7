<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<hr />

<p>Most of our daily lives are lived in a physical realm well described by early physicists like Galileo. When Einstein first introduced the theory of special relativity, he effectively set a speed limit on every massive object in the universe, the speed of light <script type="math/tex">c</script>. This may not seem like much of a change on the surface, but this opened a whole new branch of physics that has many differences to the Galilean framework. As Galileo first described terrestrial motion, velocity addition worked in the same manner as any other vector addition. Simply add together each component of each of the velocity vectors <script type="math/tex">\vec\beta=\vec v/c</script> to be added:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec\beta_{12}=\vec\beta_1+\vec\beta_2\,.\tag{1}</script>

<p>(We define velocities as a ratio like this so that the magnitude of each <script type="math/tex">\vec\beta_i</script> is between 0 and 1.)</p>

<p class="example"><b>Example:</b> Suppose you are on a train traveling at speed \(\beta_1\) (relative to the ground) and there is a different train traveling at speed \(\beta_2\) relative to you. If you hop on this different train (according to Galileo) you will now be traveling at speed \(\beta_{12}\) (relative to the ground).</p>

<p>But this Galilean transformation contains no information about Einsteinâ€™s speed limit. In principle, one could go faster than <script type="math/tex">c</script> by hopping on a train traveling at <script type="math/tex">c</script> (or <script type="math/tex">\beta > 1</script>). As this is not allowed in special relativity, we have to modify the velocity transformation such that <script type="math/tex">\vec\beta_{12}</script> canâ€™t have a superluminal speed. To do this, we will need some mathematical tools. First, we will need the Lorentz factors, which help define how things will scale as we get closer to the speed of light. Here and later on, I will define the Lorentz factor as both a function of a vector velocity <script type="math/tex">\vec\beta</script> and the individual components of a vector velocity vector <script type="math/tex">\beta_i</script>,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\vec\beta\cdot\vec\beta}}, \quad \gamma_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta_i^2}}\,,\tag{2}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">i=x,y,z</script>. Deriving the Einstein velocity transformation is a non-trivial task, so I will not include it here. The result is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec{\beta}_{12}=\frac{1}{\big(1+\vec{\beta}_1 \cdot \vec{\beta}_2\big)}
\left[\vec{\beta}_1+\vec{\beta}_2+\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_2+1}\,\vec{\beta}_2\times\Big(\vec\beta_2\times\vec{\beta}_1\Big)\right]\,.</script>

<p>This may look complicated, and it is, but the entire purpose of the above expression is simply to ensure that no matter the input velocities <script type="math/tex">\vec\beta_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">\vec\beta_2</script>, the magnitude of <script type="math/tex">\vec\beta_{12}</script> is always less than 1. This ensures that you canâ€™t go faster than the speed of light by simply jumping onto another train. Thus, this is the correct expression in special relativity to calculate your velocity after jumping trains like before.</p>

<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Of course, Galileo was not <q>wrong</q> in the sense that his transformation is approximately true. In the limit of slow input velocities ( \(\beta_1\ll 1\) and \(\beta_2\ll 1\)) the Einstein expression reduces to the Galilean one. You can see this by only keeping first order terms in the input velocities, which leaves you with only \(\vec{\beta}_{12}\approx\vec\beta_1+ \vec\beta_2\).</p>

<p>This Einstein velocity addition formula is very different from the Galilean one, which introduces many odd and interesting differences in physical dynamics. For example, the way space and time act <strong>directly depends</strong> on the reference frame you may be in. If you are standing on the ground and your friend is on a train, lengths are contracted and time ticks by slower for your friend relative to you. This is where relativity gets its name, physics is always relative to the reference frame in which you experience the world. We can describe the transformation between reference frames with the Lorentz transformation.</p>

<h1 id="lorentz-transformations">Lorentz Transformations</h1>

<hr />

<p>In non-relativistic physics, we are happy to describe everything with 3-dimensional vectors. This is because there is no reason to treat space and time together, as they act in different ways. More precisely, in the Galilean framework time ticks by at the same rate regardless of the reference frame you are in. This all changes in relativity, so we now need to be able to describe how both time and space are affected. We do this by defining 4-vectors that have their first component as a temporal component, and the last three as spatial components. Space and time are now combined into <strong>spacetime</strong>.</p>

<p class="example"><b>Example:</b> A 4-vector \(\mathbf{x}\) would look like \(\mathbf{x}=(t,x,y,z)\). If we give each of the components numerical values, a 4-vector represents a spacetime <b>event</b> because both a time and location have been specified.</p>

<p>If we want to transform such a 4-dimensional vector, we need to use 4-dimensional matrices. This is thus the form that the Lorentz transformations take. Luckily, they donâ€™t look incredibly complicated if we transform into a new reference frame moving along a Cartesian direction. The following is the transformation for a new reference frame moving in the <script type="math/tex">x</script>-direction:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\Lambda_x(\beta_x)=
  \left( {\begin{array}{cccc}
   \gamma_x & -\gamma_x \beta_x & 0 & 0 \\
   -\gamma_x \beta_x & \gamma_x & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  \end{array} }\right)\,. %]]></script>

<p>If you apply this matrix to our 4-vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{x}</script>, you would have <q>jumped</q> onto a new train. This operation is called a Lorentz boost. There is a different matrix for each Cartesian direction, such as the <script type="math/tex">y</script>-direction:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\Lambda_y(\beta_y)=
  \left( {\begin{array}{cccc}
   \gamma_y & 0 & -\gamma_y \beta_y & 0 \\
   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    -\gamma_y \beta_y & 0 & \gamma_y & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  \end{array} }\right)\,. %]]></script>

<p>There is of course also a <script type="math/tex">z</script>-direction boost, but we will not need it here. The Lorentz boost matrices have important properties that our intuition about <q>jumping on trains</q> should help us recognize as essential. Firstly, if you boost in one direction, and then boost in the opposite direction the same amount, you have effectively done nothing. This would be like jumping on a train, reversing the direction of the train, and then jumping off again, which lands you back where you started. The Lorentz transformation contains this property,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Lambda_x(-\beta)\Lambda_x(\beta)=I\,,\tag{4}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">I</script> is the 4-dimensional identity matrix. This defines the matrix inverse for this system, as all we have to do return a system to the initial state is boost in the opposite direction,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Lambda_i^{-1}(\beta) = \Lambda_i(-\beta)\,.</script>

<p>Since we know that successive uses of Equation (4) are equivalent to multiplying by the identity matrix, we can also recognize, that the following must also be true:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Lambda_x(-\beta)\Lambda_y(-\beta)\Lambda_y(\beta)\Lambda_x(\beta) = I\,.</script>

<p class="example"><b>Example:</b> Suppose you are at rest there are two trains, one moving in the \(x\)-direction (\(x\)-train) and one moving in the \(y\)-direction (\(y\)-train). The above boost sequence would be like jumping onto the \(x\)-train, followed jumping onto the \(y\)-train. We then switch the direction the trains are moving, jump back onto the \(x\)-train, and finally jump back onto the ground. You are now back to exactly the place you were before.</p>

<p>The problem comes when we switch the order of the boosts. Matrices do not necessarily commute, and the Lorentz boost matrices do not. So if we switch the third and forth boosts we will find that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Lambda_y(-\beta)\Lambda_x(-\beta)\Lambda_y(\beta)\Lambda_x(\beta) \neq I\,.</script>

<p>The actual result of this matrix multiplication is a complicated mess. Why is this the case? This has to do with the complicated velocity addition formula in special relativity. The above sequence does not in fact return the system to rest, and we will see why.</p>

<h1 id="thomas-rotation">Thomas Rotation</h1>

<hr />

<p>We need to devise a way to return a system to rest after boosting in the <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">y</script> directions, with only one boost. What velocity are we going at if we do these two boosts? We have to apply our relativistic velocity addition formula to find out. If we use <script type="math/tex">\vec\beta_1=(\beta_x,0,0)</script> and <script type="math/tex">\vec\beta_2=(0,\beta_y,0)</script>, the resulting vector <script type="math/tex">\vec\beta_{xy}</script> is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vec\beta_{xy}=(\beta_x/\gamma_y,\beta_y,0)\,.</script>

<p>We know that the system is traveling at this velocity, so we only need to boost in the opposite direction to this in order to return the system to rest. This requires a general Lorentz transformation matrix, since the boost is no longer along a Cartesian axis. It is big and scary  looking,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\Lambda\big(\vec{\beta}\,\big)=
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
\gamma & -\gamma \beta_x & -\gamma \beta_y & -\gamma \beta_z \\
-\gamma \beta_x & 1+{\dfrac{\gamma^2 \beta_x^2}{\gamma+1}} & {\dfrac{\gamma^2 \beta_x\beta_y}{\gamma+1}} & {\dfrac{\gamma^2 \beta_x \beta_z}{\gamma+1}} \\
-\gamma \beta_y & {\dfrac{\gamma^2 \beta_x \beta_y}{\gamma+1}} & 1+{\dfrac{\gamma^2 \beta_y^2}{\gamma+1}} & {\dfrac{\gamma^2 \beta_y \beta_z}{\gamma+1}} \\
-\gamma \beta_z & {\dfrac{\gamma^2 \beta_x \beta_z}{\gamma+1}} & {\dfrac{\gamma^2 \beta_y \beta_z}{\gamma+1}} & 1+{\dfrac{\gamma^2 \beta_z^2}{\gamma+1}} \\
\end{array} \right)\,. %]]></script>

<p>Importantly, this general transform reduces to the <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">y</script> direction ones if we plug in a boost vector along one of those Cartesian axes. We want to plug in <script type="math/tex">-\vec\beta_{xy}</script> to this matrix in order to return our system to rest:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Lambda(-\vec\beta_{xy})\Lambda_y(\beta_y)\Lambda_x(\beta_x) =\,?\,.</script>

<p>What do you expect this resulting matrix to look like? I for one, would expect the result we had before, the identity matrix. This however is not the case, as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Lambda(-\vec\beta_{xy})\Lambda_y(\beta_y)\Lambda_x(\beta_x) = R(\beta_x,\beta_y)\,,</script>

<p>where</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
R(\beta_x,\beta_y)=
\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \frac{\gamma_x+\,\gamma_y}{1+\,\gamma_x\gamma_y} & -\frac{\gamma_x\beta_x\gamma_y\beta_y}{1+\,\gamma_x\gamma_y} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{\gamma_x\beta_x\gamma_y\beta_y}{1+\,\gamma_x\gamma_y} & \frac{\gamma_x+\,\gamma_y}{1+\,\gamma_x\gamma_y} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array} \right)\,. %]]></script>

<p>If you are familiar with rotation matrices, you might recognize this as one. This matrix represents  a rotation around the <script type="math/tex">z</script>-axis. Using the properties of rotation matrices, we can pick out a formula for the angle of rotation, the Thomas rotation angle:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\boxed{\cos(\theta)=\frac{\gamma_x+\gamma_y}{1+\gamma_x\gamma_y}}\,.</script>

<p>What has happened here? We have indeed returned our system to rest, as we wanted, but our coordinate system has been rotated. This is by no means an intuitive result, and this very property of special relativity confused physicists long before special relativity was proposed. Thomas rotation is linked to other concepts in physics like Thomas precession and the gyromagnetic ratio. For a long time, physicists could not understand why quantum mechanics could not reproduce the correct gyromagnetic ratio, and it was only when quantum mechanics was updated to include relativity that the correct one was obtained.</p>

<p>This is not a general result for the Thomas rotation angle, as we have only considered a specific case of two orthogonal boosts. To keep this blog post short and accessible to a wider audience, I do not go into the general derivation, but I have written it up if you are interested here.</p>
