<p>The global scale of the GPS network offers a unique opportunity to search for spatially-extended DM objects (or ‚Äúclumps‚Äù), such as topological defects (TDs), which are otherwise not detectable by most ongoing and planned DM searches. The large number of clocks and the very large aperture of the network increase both the chance of an interaction and the sensitivity of the search, since we seek the correlated propagation of new physics signals throughout the entire network. The large network diameter also increases the overall interaction time. Therefore, by analyzing the GPS timing data, one can perform a sensitive search for transient signals of exotic physics, and if no sought signals are found, stringent limits on the relevant interaction strengths can be placed.</p>

<p>Recently, our GPS.DM collaboration carried out an initial analysis of the archival GPS data, looking for signatures of a particular type of TDs (domain walls, quasi-2D cosmic structures). While no such signatures were found, we placed limits on certain DM couplings to atoms that are many orders of magnitude more stringent than the previous constraints. Here, we present a search method based on Bayesian statistics. We demonstrate that compared to our initial search, the Bayesian approach greatly increases the search sensitivity. This approach also broadens the discovery reach to more general DM models and to lower DM field masses.</p>
