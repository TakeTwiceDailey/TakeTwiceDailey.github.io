Here you will find an archive of my personal interests and history. A directory can be found in the side-panel to the left, along with links to social media and contact information. You are welcome take a look at my curriculum vitae, a synopsis of my research, some of my photography, or check out some of my blog posts.


## About me

I am a graduate student researching physics. Some of my current interests are

* strong gravity
  * special and general relativity
  * black hole and neutron star mergers
  * quantum gravity
* Bayesian statistics
  * statistical modeling
  * Monte-Carlo simulations
* machine learning
  * solving physics problems with neural networks


## Short History

I studied at the University of Nevada, Reno under Dr. Andrei Derevianko and with the GPS.DM Collaboration. As an undergraduate I contributed to research involving a search for dark matter using the global positioning system (GPS). I also completed my Master's degree with the same group, where I researched new ways to use GPS for astrophysics applications. Our new concept involves correlating bursts of exotic fields sourced from high-energy astrophysical events, such has the known gravitational wave events.
