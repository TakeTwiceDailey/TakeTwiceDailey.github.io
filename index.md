* **Strong Gravity**
  * special and general relativity
  * numerical methods for solving Einstein's equations
  * black hole and neutron star mergers
  * gravitational waves
* **Multi-messenger Astronomy**
  * detecting astrophysical events with light and gravitational waves 
  * new pathways of detection with exotic fields
* **Machine Learning**
  * solving physics problems with neural networks
  * solving differential equations with neural networks

## Short History

I studied at the University of Nevada, Reno under Dr. Andrei Derevianko and with the GPS.DM Collaboration. As an undergraduate I contributed to a search for dark matter using GPS. I completed my Master's degree with the same group, where I researched new ways to use GPS for astrophysics applications. Our novel concept involves correlating bursts of exotic fields sourced from high-energy astrophysical events such as the merger of binary black holes. I currently study at the University of Waterloo, with residency at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, where I work with the Strong Gravity group along with my advisors Niayesh Afshordi and Erik Schnetter.
