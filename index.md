## About me

I am a physics graduate student, some of my current interests include:

* **strong gravity**
  * special and general relativity
  * black hole and neutron star mergers
  * unified theories
* **Bayesian statistics**
  * statistical modeling
  * Monte-Carlo simulations
* **machine learning**
  * solving physics problems with neural networks


## Short History

I studied at the University of Nevada, Reno under Dr. Andrei Derevianko and with the GPS.DM Collaboration. As an undergraduate I contributed to a search for dark matter using GPS. I completed my Master's degree with the same group, where I researched new ways to use GPS for astrophysics applications. Our novel concept involves correlating bursts of exotic fields sourced from high-energy astrophysical events such as the LIGO gravitational wave events.
