  * solving physics problems with neural networks
  * solving differential equations with neural networks

## Short History

I studied at the University of Nevada, Reno under Dr. Andrei Derevianko and with the GPS.DM Collaboration. As an undergraduate I contributed to a search for dark matter using GPS. I completed my Master's degree with the same group, where I researched new ways to use GPS for astrophysics applications. Our novel concept involves correlating bursts of exotic fields sourced from high-energy astrophysical events such as the merger of binary black holes. I did my Ph.D. at the University of Waterloo, with residency at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, where I worked with the Strong Gravity group along with my advisors Niayesh Afshordi and Erik Schnetter. My Ph.D. was focused on developing novel methods in numerical relativity to simulate black holes with reflecting boundaries near their horizons. My work has marked a substantial leap in the understanding of the initial boundary value problem in general relativity. I currently work as a postdoc at the Theoretical Physics Institute at the Frierich Schiller University in Jena under Dr. Bernd Bruegmann.
