title: Machine Learning in Mathematica
---

Wolfram Mathematica has made machine learning functionality a large part of the recent updates in versions 11 and 12. If you are completely new this functionality, as I was, you can explore some of the functions the Wolfram team has added [here](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/MachineLearning.html).

> The Wolfram Language includes a wide range of state-of-the-art integrated machine learning capabilities, from highly automated functions like Predict and Classify to functions based on specific methods and diagnostics, including the latest neural net approaches. The functions work on many types of data, including numerical, categorical, time series, textual, image and audio.

I have found that their documentation and guides for machine learning are more geared to people who already have a good understanding in the subject. So I have included a general introduction and several simple examples myself in this post, might be useful to others.
